# Welcome to Project Balls
## Only thing that you need to do its run the index.html file.
### If it will be necessary install TypeScript with command **_npm install -g typescript_**
### For compiling TypeScript to JavaScript run **_npx tsc_**
#### Please note that after compilation, in the resulting files you may need to add a format for the imported files (for example, ./tools to add .js).
